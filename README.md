# Coupon Assignment Data Analysis

This repository contains a data analysis assignment on coupon usage using pandas and Jupyter Notebook.

## Summary of Findings

- Analyzed the possible characteristics of drivers who accepted the Bar coupons and Restaurants of less than 20$ coupons
- For Bar coupons:
found that: those who go to Bars more than once/month, with an age of >25 and <30, had passengers that were not a kid, had occupations other than farming, fishing, or forestry, are not widowed, go to cheap restaurants more than 4 times a month and income is less than 50K are more likely to accept the bar coupons 
- For the restaurants less than 20 $ coupons:
  found that: those who visit those restaurants > 4 times/ months are slightly more likely to accept those coupons. Otherwise, being younger or older than 30 yrs old, having low vs high income, being single, and not having children wasn't associated with increased rates of acceptance.
