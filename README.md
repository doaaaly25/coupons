This repository contains a data analysis assignment on coupon usage using pandas and Jupyter Notebook.

Summary of Findings
-Bar Coupons:
People more likely to accept bar coupons tend to:

Visit bars more than once per month

Be between 25 and 30 years old

Travel without kids as passengers

Work in occupations other than farming, fishing, or forestry

Not be widowed

Dine at inexpensive restaurants more than 4 times a month

Have an income less than $50K

-Restaurant (< $20) Coupons:

Visiting inexpensive restaurants more than 4 times per month slightly increases the likelihood of accepting the coupon.

Other factors like age (< or > 30), income level, marital status, or having children were not strongly associated with coupon acceptance.
